            Hello, Iâ€™m John! I live in Edmonds, Washington, and I am a software
            developer. I have loved coding from a young age. From coding with
            blocks to writing my first lines of JavaScript, I always enjoyed
            creating, debugging, and discussing code. I completed BrainStation
            {"'"}s software engineering bootcamp and am now in the process of
            diving into the industry.
